abstract: |
  Understanding the spatial distribution of educational infrastructure is essential for ensuring equitable access to schooling. This study examines regional disparities in school availability across Brunei and the neighboring Malaysian states of Sarawak and Sabah, with a focus on identifying potential underserved areas. First, exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to compare school counts and student-teacher ratios at the district level across the three regions. The core analysis employs Standardized Incidence Ratio (SIR) and Bayesian spatial Poisson model using Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) to estimate the relative abundance of schools across Bruneiâ€™s districts, adjusting for expected counts based on population, region size and socioeconomic indicator (house price + partially simulated). Spatially structured and unstructured random effects were incorporated to account for latent spatial processes. Posterior estimates identified districts with significantly lower school availability than the national baseline, supporting future policy planning and school placement.

## Introduction

Education is a foundational pillar of human and national development, influencing social well-being, economic growth, and long-term sustainability. Ensuring equitable access to education through sufficient infrastructure, fair resource distribution, and balanced studentâ€“teacher ratios is critical to delivering quality learning experiences.

The global significance of education is recognized in Sustainable Development Goal 4, which promotes inclusive and equitable quality education for all [1]. Nationally, Brunei Darussalamâ€™s national vision, Wawasan Brunei 2035, positions education as a cornerstone of the country's long-term development goals. 

While several studies have examined general aspects of education in Brunei, there have been limited studies based on quantitative spatial methods, with only one examining the spatial distribution and hotspots of schools. This project aims to addresses that gap by first conducting a comparative analysis of school availability and studentâ€“teacher ratios across Bruneiâ€™s districts, with additional context from neighboring Malaysian states, Sarawak and Sabah. Given that Brunei has higher PISA scores than Malaysia, it would be interesting to explore whether accessibility may be a potential factor. / Malaysia has more population than Brunei, how does the school compare

Next, Standardized Incidence Ratios (SIR) and Bayesian hierarchical models are used to identify districts where school availability falls significantly below the national baseline,  supporting future policy planning future school placements.

## Data
In this study, we only focus on primary and secondary public schoools. School dataset 2018 is used becaused Although newer school statistics exist, they are only published in summary form. Thus, we use the 2018 school dataset, which provides more granular spatial detail necessary for district- and mukim-level aggregation.Population census data from 2021 was used despite the mismatch in year with the school data, as Brunei conducts a national census only once every ten years, and 2021 is the most recent available.

Various data variables sourced were joined using left_join() and merged using rbind() after preprocessing, sourced:

### Brunei
Data on school locations, studentâ€“teacher ratios, administrative boundaries, and population were sourced from the `bruneimap` R package. The school dataset (sch_sf) includes georeferenced point data for each institution. For this analysis, we filtered the dataset to include only government primary and secondary schools, to align with available school data in Malaysia.

Despite composing of only four districts, district-level aggregation was used for broader comparisons, such as studentâ€“teacher ratios and school counts, to match the smallest available administrative unit in Malaysian data. Mukims ($N = 39$), a finer administrative level, were used for the Bayesian spatial analysis of school availability. 

To incorporate a socioeconomic indicator, median house of each region data from approximately 30,000 property listings spanning 1993â€“2025. The median house price was calculated per mukim to represent local socioeconomic variation. Some mukims had missing data; these values were imputed using predictions from an INLA-based Gaussian model. Manual corrections based on local knowledge were initially tested, but INLA-predicted values were ultimately used, as both methods yielded similar model outcomes. Given the nature of the dataset, house prices were treated as partially simulated estimates.

### Malaysia
Malaysian data were sourced from the national open data portal [data.gov.my], including district-level school counts and population estimates for Sarawak and Sabah. The school data were filtered to include government primary and secondary schools only, for comparability with Brunei data.

Administrative boundary (districts) were obtained via the `geomdata` R package, as OpenStreetMap (`osmdata`) does not provide administrative divisions at the required level of granularity.

Some inconsistencies were found between school and boundary data, especially where older districts had been split into newer ones. In these cases, school counts were only available for the original (larger) districts. To maintain consistency, we excluded the newer subdivisions and manually recoded schools in affected areas to align them with the closest valid district.



## Method {#sec-method}

Exploratory data anlysis using Clorepath maps for schools count, by area (usingst_area) studnet teacher ratio

Neighbour type

POisson INLA hierarchical model

covariates: 
house price as socio economic index

Spatial Poisson model
Justify offset (population)
Explain fixed and random effects
Introduce INLA + BYM


## Results {#sec-results}

- School count quite similar, more in main city
- studnet teacher ratio, primary simiilar other than dense city (miri, kuching, kota kinabalu), but brunei has lesser secondary std-tcr
- There are significantly fewer schools in Mukim xxx

## Discussion & Limitation

There are significantly fewer schools in Mukim xxx, when explored, its not forested area. Housing region, some may be newer nieghbourhood so.. good idea for mroe schools there, nearer from home, less transportation cost, environmental, time. 

Limitation:
only public schools, age groups, 2018 data, school types, 
some simulation in housing price,
house price is listing price (only a proxy for market values), may deviate from actual sales price due to negotian dynamics and other factors
## Conclusions {#sec-conc}

- School count quite similar, more in main city
- studnet teacher ratio, primary simiilar other than dense city (miri, kuching, kota kinabalu), but brunei has lesser secondary std-tcr
- There are significantly fewer schools in Mukim xxx
